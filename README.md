# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification 

An **interactive Machine Learning web application** that classifies images as either a **Cat or a Dog**.

This project uses **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with **HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)** feature extraction to analyze image structure and perform classification.

The model is deployed using a **Streamlit web app** where users can upload images and get real-time predictions with confidence scores.

# 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

This project follows a classical ML pipeline for image classification.

## Workflow:

1. Load dataset (cats and dogs images)
2. Preprocess images (resize + grayscale conversion)
3. Extract features using HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
4. Train SVM classifier
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Deploy using Streamlit

## Algorithm Used:

* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Kernel: RBF (Radial Basis Function)

---

# 📊 Features

## 🖼️ Image Classification

Users can upload an image and the model predicts:

* 🐱 Cat
* 🐶 Dog

---

## 📈 Confidence Score

The model provides probability scores for each class:

* Cat probability (%)
* Dog probability (%)

---

## ⚡ Real-Time Prediction

Instant prediction results after image upload.
